# NLPMindReader

MindReader is a Shiny app for text prediction that I developed as my Capstone project for the Coursera/John Hopkins University Data Science Specialization in R.

The app can be access at https://ndescussebrown.shinyapps.io/MindReader/, and takes one word as input in order to predict the next one.
